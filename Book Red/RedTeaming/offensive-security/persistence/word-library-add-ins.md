# Word Library Add-Ins

It' possible to persist in the userland by abusing word library add-ins by putting your malicious DLL into a Word's trusted location. Once the DLL is there, the Word will load it next time it is run.

## Execution

Get Word's trusted locations where library add-ins can be dropped:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="attacker@target" %}
```csharp
 Get-ChildItem "hkcu:\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Word\Security\Trusted Locations"
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Annotation 2019-06-22 121402.png>)

Those trusted locations are actually defined in Word's Security Center if you have access to the GUI:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Annotation 2019-06-22 121426.png>)

Let's create a simple DLL that will launch a notepad.exe once the DLL addin is loaded:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Annotation 2019-06-22 143558.png>)

Compile the DLL and copy it over to `Startup` folder and rename it to `evilm64.wll`:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Annotation 2019-06-22 121537.png>)

```
mv .\evilm64.dll .\evilm64.wll
```

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Annotation 2019-06-22 144024.png>)

Next time the victim opens up Word, `evilm64.wll` will be loaded and executed:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Annotation 2019-06-22 143432.png>)

Interesting to note that Process Explorer does not see the evilm64.wll loaded in any of the currently running processes:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Annotation 2019-06-22 144128.png>)

...although we can definitely see that the add-in is now recognized by Word:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Annotation 2019-06-22 144219.png>)

This technique did not work for me on Office 365 version, but worked on Office Professional. Not sure if there's a bug in the 365 version or it's just a limitation of that version.
