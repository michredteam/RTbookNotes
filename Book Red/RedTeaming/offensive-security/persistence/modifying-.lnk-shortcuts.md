# Modifying .lnk Shortcuts

This is a quick lab showing how .lnk (shortcut files) can be used for persistence.

## Execution

Say, there's a shortcut on the compromised system for a program HxD64 as shown below:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (432).png>)

. That shortcut can be hijacked and used for persistence. Let's change the shortcut's target to this simple powershell:

```csharp
powershell.exe -c "invoke-item \\VBOXSVR\Tools\HxD\HxD64.exe; invoke-item c:\windows\system32\calc.exe"
```

It will launch the HxD64, but will also launch a program of our choice - a calc.exe in this case. Notice how the shortcut icon changed to powershell - that is expected:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (433).png>)

We can change it back by clicking "Change Icon" and specifying the original .exe of HxD64.exe:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (434).png>)

The original icon is now back:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (435).png>)

## Demo

Below shows the hijack demo in action:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/lnk-hijacking.gif)

In the above gif, we can see the black cmd prompt for a brief moment, however, it can be easily be hidden by changing the `Run` option of the shortcut to `Minimized`:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (436).png>)

Running the demo again with the `Run: Minimized` shows the black prompt went away:

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that hovering the shortcut reveals that the program to be launched is the powershell.
