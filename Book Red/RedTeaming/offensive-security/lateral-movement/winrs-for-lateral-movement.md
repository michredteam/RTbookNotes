It's possible to use a native Windows binary `winrs` to connect to a remote endpoint via `WinRM` like so:

```
winrs -r:ws01 "cmd /c hostname & notepad"
```

Below shows how we connect from `DC01` to `WS01` and execute two processes `hostname`,`notepad` and the process partent/child relationship for processes spawned by the `winrshost.exe`:
