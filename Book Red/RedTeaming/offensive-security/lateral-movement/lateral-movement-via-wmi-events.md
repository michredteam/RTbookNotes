# Lateral Movement via WMI Event Subscription

This is a quick lab to familiariaze with a lateral movement technique using WMI events, as described in [@domchell](https://twitter.com/domchell) aricle [I Like to Move It: Windows Lateral Movement Part 1 â€“ WMI Event Subscription](https://www.mdsec.co.uk/2020/09/i-like-to-move-it-windows-lateral-movement-part-1-wmi-event-subscription/) - go check it out for more details, including detection ideas.

## Walkthrough

The below C# code for WMI events based lateral movement does a couple of things:

| Line                              | Action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 29 - 33                           | Connects to the remote endpoint `192.168.56.105` using local admin credentials `spotless:123456`                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 33 - 46                           | <p>Creates a new WMI filter <code>evilSpotlessFilter</code> on <code>192.168.56.105</code>. <br>It will get triggered when a new logon session is created on <code>192.168.56.105</code></p>                                                                                       |
| 49 - 52                           | <p>Creates a WMI consumer <code>evilSpotlessConsumer</code> on <code>192.168.56.105</code>. <br>This consumer executes <code>mspaint.exe</code> on <code>192.168.56.105</code>, when the filter <code>evilSpotlessFilter</code> is triggered (upon new logon session creation)</p> |
| 55 - 58                           | WMI filter `evilSpotlessFilter` and WMI consumer `evilSpotlessConsumer` are bound. In layman's terms, the system `192.168.56.105` is instructed to **DEFINITELY** fire `mspaint.exe` on each new logon session that is created on the system.                                      |

## Observations

Once `connect` method is called, a couple of connections from the attacking machine (top right) are initiated to the target machine `192.168.56.105` (bottom right) over port TCP 135 (traffic receiver is svchost.exe as it's hosting the RPC service through which we are communicating):

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (655).png>)

After the code has executed, it will have created the WMI event filters, consumers and bind them on the target host `192.168.56.105`.

On the target host, we can check if the said filters and consumers were created like so:

```csharp
# view wmi filters
Get-WmiObject -Class __EventFilter -Namespace root\subscription

# view wmi consumers
Get-WmiObject -Class __EventConsumer -Namespace root\subscription

# view bindings
Get-WmiObject -Class __FilterToConsumerBinding -Namespace root\subscription
```

Below shows output of the `evilSpotlessFilter` WMI filter we created on the target system:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (656).png>)

## Demo

Below shows the WMI events based lateral movement technique in action:

* On the left, we compile and run the code that creates WMI event filters, consumers and binds them together
* In the top right corner - ther is a ProcMon that is set to capture when a new `mspaint.exe` process starts. In our case, it should start once there is a new logon session created on the system (remember, because of the `evilSpotlessFilter`)
* In the bottom right corner there is a powershell console initiating a new logon session with `runas.exe`. Once the authentication succeeds, a new logon session is created, cmd.exe is spawned and the WMI event filter `evilSpotlessFilter` is triggered and WMI event consumer `evilSpotlessConsumer` kicks off the `mspaint.exe`:
