# Disabling Windows Event Logs by Suspending EventLog Service Threads

This lab was inspired by an old post [Phant0m: Killing Windows Event Log](https://artofpwn.com/phant0m-killing-windows-event-log.html) by [@hlldz](https://twitter.com/hlldz) where he introduced a powershell tool [Invoke-Phant0m](https://github.com/hlldz/Invoke-Phant0m), which disables Windows EventLog service by killing its threads hosted by the svchost.exe.

The purpose of this quick lab is to understand some of the inner workings of Invoke-Phant0m. In particular, I wanted to play around with Windows APIs related to retrieving a process ID that hosts a given service, thread enumeration, mapping threads to a particular service (Windows Eventlog in this case) hosted in the svchost.exe and so on. This would give me a better understanding of how I can target specific threads when I need to, I thought.

Although this lab was inspired by @hlldz' post, you will notice that we implemented the same technique in a slightly different way by levarging different Windows APIs.

## Overview

Windows event logs are handled by `EventLog` service that is hosted by svchost.exe.

If we list svchost processes, we see a number of those:

From the above screenshot, it's not clear which process actually hosts the `EventLog` service, but if we keep inspecting `svchost.exe` processes one by one in Process Hacker, we will eventually find the process hosting the `EventLog` service, which in my case it is `svchost.exe` with pid 2196:

Note that we can find out the PID of the process that is hosting `EventLog`:

```csharp
Get-WmiObject -Class win32_service -Filter "name = 'eventlog'" | select -exp ProcessId
```

If we look into svchost.exe threads for `EventLog`, we see there are a couple of threads of interest as highlighted in blue:

Below shows that indeed, suspending the threas is enough to disable the EventLog service from registering any new events:

Based on the above, the main goal of this lab is to hack some code to find these threads and simply suspend them and disable windows event logging this way.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Resuming threads will write out the events to the events log as if the threads had not been suspended in the first place.
{% endhint %}

## Code

Below is the code for the technique that at a high level works like this:

1. Open a handle to Service Control Manager with `OpenSCManagerA`
2. Open a handle to EventLog service with `OpenServiceA`
3. Retrieve svchost.exe (hosting EventLog) process ID with `QueryServiceStatusEx`
4. Open a handle to the svchost.exe process (from step 3)
5. Get a list of loaded modules loaded by svchost.exe `EnumProcessModules`
6. Loop through the list of `svchost` loaded modules, retrieved in step 5, find their names with `GetModuleBaseName` and find the base address of the module `wevtsvc.dll` - this is the module containing `EventLog` service inner-workings
7. Get `wevtsvc.dll` module info with `GetModuleInformation`. It will return a structure with module's start address and its image size - we will need these details later, when determiing if `EventLog` service thread's fall into wevtsvc.dll module's memory space
8. Enumerate all the threads inside svchost.exe with `Thread32First` and `Thread32Next`
9. For each thread from step 8, retrieve the thread's start address with `NtQueryInformationThread`
10. For each thread from step 8, check if the thread's start address belongs to the `wevtsvc.dll` memory space inside svchost.exe
11. If thread's start address is inside the `wevtsvc.dll` memory space, this is our victim thread and we suspend it with `SuspendThread`
12. `EventLog` service is now disabled

## Demo

Below GIF illustrates:

* `net user ola ola` is executed and user's ola password is changed and an event `4724` logged at 6:55:30 PM
* 4 EventLog threads are suspended in svchost.exe (PID 2196)
* `net user ola ola` is executed again at 6:55:38 PM, but no new event `4724` is captured
