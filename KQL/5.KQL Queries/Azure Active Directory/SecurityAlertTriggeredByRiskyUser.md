# Security Alerts triggered by users at risk

## Query Information

#### Description
This query identifies the users that are currently at risk. Based on that it performs a lookup on the security alerts that have been triggered with that user as entity. This can indicate that a useraccount has been compromised, because it has peformed risky sign in activities as well as malicious activities defined by security products or custom detection rules. 

#### Risk
Alerts on a user at risk may indicate that the useraccount has been compromised. Investigate the useraccount in more detail and disable the user if malicious activity is confirmed.
